                    <p> The use of AI is becoming more and more popular to facilitate tasks, from personal tasks to 
                        business use. Just as laws were created for other inventions, for example, automobiles, new laws have been created,
                        or will be created to control the use of AI technologies; the new laws and 
                        the AI technologies will become part of peopleâ€™s lives, 
                        therefore people need to understand the ethical, social, and legal consequences of AI technologies.
