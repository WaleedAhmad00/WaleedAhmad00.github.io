                <h2>Implications of AI technologies</h2> <!-- Subheading -->


                <!--Paragraphs go here -->
                <p> The presence of AI around us is increasing everyday that passes. Everyone must be informed about the 
                    implications that AI technologies will have on their lives. It is also of great importance that new AI 
                    developers understand the ethics of AI technologies, so they can take care when creating new AI-based 
                    applications. 
                </p>
                <p> It is important to understand that AI will not affect only singular users; it will have an impact on entire societies; countries will be affected. An example of countries being affected is demonstrated by how the European Parliament had to come 
                    forward and formulate a law to regulate AI systems. This types of initiatives from around the world must be acknowledged to promote collaboration among all the nations, so AI can be regulated timely and appropriately.

                <h2>Impact on Society</h2> <!--Subheading for Social Considerations -->
                <p>AI is changing the way we live and work. It's making things like shopping, driving, and even healthcare easier and more efficient. But it's also raising questions about things like privacy, fairness, and job security. As AI becomes more common, we need to think about how to use it responsibly to benefit everyone in society.
                It could increase digital divide due to the fact that not everyone will be able to make use of such technology. 
                </p>
                <p> AI can help doctors analyze medical images like X-rays or MRIs more quickly and accurately, which means patients can get diagnosed and treated faster. However, there are also concerns about privacy, as AI systems may store sensitive patient data. So, while AI improves healthcare in many ways, we also need to ensure that patient information is kept secure.

                <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>   
                <p> This involves in thinking about what's right and fair. We have to make sure AI decisions aren't biased against certain groups of people. Plus, we need to be careful about how AI systems use people's personal information. It's also important to think about how AI might affect jobs and make sure everyone has opportunities to learn and adapt. By considering these ethical issues, we can use AI in a way that benefits everyone.
                </p>
                <p>  In social impact we consider how AI influences workplaces or how it causes changes the current cultural norms. Ethical considerations focus on what is right and fair, and whether a new and upcoming AI technology will cause personal problems to people.
                </p>
                <p> Imagine a company using AI to help with hiring new employees. The AI system is trained on past hiring data, which unintentionally favors candidates from certain backgrounds. As a result, qualified candidates from underrepresented groups may be unfairly overlooked, leading to a less diverse and inclusive workplace. This raises ethical concerns about fairness and equality in the hiring process.

                <h2>Legal Implications</h2>
                <p> The legal impact of AI refers to how artificial intelligence technologies interact with existing laws and regulations. For example, in the case of autonomous vehicles, there are questions about liability in the event of accidents: is it the manufacturer, the owner, or the AI system itself that's responsible? Additionally, AI raises concerns about data privacy and security, as algorithms may collect and analyze large amounts of personal information. To address these issues, new laws and regulations may need to be developed to ensure that AI is used responsibly and ethically, while also protecting the rights of individuals and society as a whole.
